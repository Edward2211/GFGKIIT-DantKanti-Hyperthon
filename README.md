'Brain Buster' allows users to answer multiple-choice questions and track their score. The app displays one question at a time with several choices. Users select an answer, and the app checks if it’s correct, updating the score accordingly. After answering, the "Next" button appears to move to the following question. Once all questions are completed, the app displays the final score. Designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app offers a simple, interactive way to take quizzes with a clean interface and responsive features, making it ideal for learning or casual play.
